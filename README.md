### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Bailin Huang

I'm a fullstack developer that loves UX, UI and frontend technologies. 
I'm probably working on personal projects and trying out new technologies. 
Some of the technologies I enjoy are ReactJS and JavaScript. 

In the meantime, you can checkout my [website](https://bailinhuang.github.io) (it's in the works âš’)

I also take [photos ðŸ“· ](https://www.instagram.com/bailin.photo/)
